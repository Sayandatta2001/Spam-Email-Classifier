This project basically uses to filter out the spam emails from a list of datasets of emails and identify which email is spam or not based on certain feature extraction process that it uses.
Basically, it is Classifier that uses certain ml algorithms to sort out and use datasets of training and testing parts to sort and filter out the emails based on certain characteristics.
These algorithms analyze various features within emails, such as keywords, sender information, email structure, and even the tone and grammar of the message.
Based on the extracted features, the classifier assigns a label to each email, indicating whether it is likely to be spam.
The primary goal of a spam email classifier is to identify and filter out unwanted or potentially harmful emails, protecting users from phishing attempts, malware, and other malicious content.
Algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Random Forests are commonly used for spam classification, as they learn from labeled data.
